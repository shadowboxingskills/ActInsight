It targets projects mobilizing effective adaptation measures, and in particular non-infrastructural solutions: (1) Adaptation strategy and action plan (impact / climate vulnerability study, adaptation strategy, flood/drought plan, demand management plan and water supply development, Nature-Based Solutions and other ""no-regret"" measures); (2) Capacity and knowledge building (i.e. hydro-meteorological network, Water Information System -WIS, warning system, hydroclimatic modeling); (3) Governance (legal and institutional framework, training of staff from basin organizations on climate issues, establishment/strengthening of basin committees, association with basin adaptation planning); (4) Adequate funding (sustainable financing mechanisms in line with the polluter/user pays principles and cost recovery, cost/effectiveness analysis of the planned adaptation actions). A leverage effect from 1 to 100 is expected from the modest budget required for this incubation to the budget required for project implementation. Join the initiative!
